Solution for Module 2 Coding Assignment for a Coursera Course (HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers)
## What does the site look like?
- It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text.
- Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). 

**Hint: use relative and absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22.**
### Spacing
- Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal and vertical).
- Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of the browser window. 
- Note the spacing between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section.
- Make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region.
**Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as discussed in Lecture 19.**
### Borders and Colors 
- Each section should have a background color set to some color (of your choosing)
- Set the background color of each section title region to some unique color (of your choosing). Make sure that the background color still allows the user to view the text in the section and section title regions.
- Set a black border on both the section and section title region that is **1px** thick.


- How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use media queries discussed in Lecture 23.)
### Layout for desktop view (992px and above)
- Each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen.
- As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. (**Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24**). 
### Layout for tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively)
- The first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. 
- The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself.
### Layout for mobile view (equal to or less than 767px)
- Each section should take up the entire row.
### Optional font setup
- set the font size of the heading and section title to be 75% larger and 25% larger (respectively) than the font size of the dummy text.
