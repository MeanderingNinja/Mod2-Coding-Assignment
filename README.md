Solution for Module 2 Coding Assignment for a Coursera Course (HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers)
## What does the site look like?
It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text.
How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use media queries discussed in Lecture 23.)
### Layout for desktop view (992px and above)
- Each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen.
- As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24). 
### Layout for tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively)
- The first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. 
- The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself.
### Layout for mobile view (equal to or less than 767px)
- Each section should take up the entire row.
